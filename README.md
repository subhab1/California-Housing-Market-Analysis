### Choropleth Map 
A choropleth map of median house prices in California for 2023 is a type of thematic map where different counties are colored in relation to the median house prices in each area. The colors on the map represent different price ranges, allowing viewers to easily identify which counties have higher or lower median home prices at a glance.A 2023 choropleth map of California's median house prices would provide insights into how economic factors like demand, location, and availability of homes are influencing the real estate market across the state.

### County Comparison Graph with Economic Indicators
California's housing market is one of the most dynamic and expensive in the United States, influenced by a combination of high demand, limited supply, and economic factors such as income levels, job availability, and interest rates. Major cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego see some of the highest median home prices, driven by economic opportunities and lifestyle amenities that attract buyers. By comparing economic indicators like GDP, interest rates, and unemployment across counties, this analysis highlights regional trends and provides insights into the economic pressures shaping Californiaâ€™s housing market.
